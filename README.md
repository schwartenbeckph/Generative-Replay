# Generative-Replay

Code to run the main analyses from https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.06.447249v1.

Replay results can be reproduced based on summary stats in results file 'Replay_InferenceTime.mat' or re-run using individual pre-processed data. Either way, start with the 'Replay_InferenceTime.m' (Figures 6 D-F) and 'Replay_InferenceLag.m' (Figure 6C) script.

MEG RSA can be reproduced using 'RSA_inference.m' (Figure 5).

Note that currently there's only individual preprocessed data for the first two subjects. Data from the remaining subjects can be found at https://www.dropbox.com/sh/c52di7x1tt2k3jp/AABPov3W6-c9dH0TViBECHj7a?dl=0.
