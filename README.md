# Generative-Replay

Code to run the main replay analysis from https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.06.447249v1 (Figure 6)

Results can be reproduced based on summary stats in results file 'Replay_InferenceTime.mat' or re-run using individual pre-processed data. Either way, start with the 'Replay_InferenceTime.m' script.

Note that currently there's only individual preprocessed data for the first two subjects. Data from the remaining subjects can be downloaded from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/d38ff1qztfug4ph/AABux8-saqBeU5sXrY7Cw1joa?dl=0.
